- 👋 Hi, I’m @CapatlCity! I am based in Richmond, VA but originally from Atlanta, GA.
- 👀 I’m interested in a swift and successful transition from property management to tech. I am open to starting out as a Help Desk or Customer Support Tech late this summer, but see myself ultimately in a Data Analysis role within a year or two. I got bills to pay and traveling I want to do!
- 🌱 As of March 2022, I am enrolled in a Computer Science certificate program (Harvard/EdX CS50), on track to earn a HTML5 & CSS3 certificate via Cengage Learning, working my way through certification projects in Applied Visual Design via FreeCodeCamp, and watching CS50P bi-weekly lectures on python on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CS50projects, just to confirm if I am doing my projects correctly prior to submission. I would hate to fail a certificate course :D
- 📫 How to reach me...Here would be the best place. You can follow me on IG as I am rarely on Twitter. HMU if you are taking CS50 currently!
- Edits here were completed using VS Code first, as the instructor of the HTML Intro course on Cengage does not use or require use of GitHub as part of his course.
