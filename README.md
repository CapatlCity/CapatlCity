- 👋 Hi, I’m @CapatlCity
- 👀 I’m interested in a swift and successful transition from property management to tech. I am open to starting out as a Help Desk or Customer Support Tech late this summer, but see myself ultimately in a Data Analysis role within a year or two. I got bills to pay and traveling I want to do!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science (Harvard/EdX CS50), HTML/CSS via another certification program, Applied Visual Design via FreeCodeCamp, and maybe python on the side if needed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CS50projects, just to confirm if I am doing my projects correctly prior to submission. I would hate to fail a certificate course :D
- 📫 How to reach me...Here would be the best place. You can follow me on IG as I am rarely on Twitter. HMU if you are taking CS50 currently!
